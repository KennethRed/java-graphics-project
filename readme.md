# Graphics2D project - Something Visual

Running this project will spawn a new window. In this window a panel will be rendered.
In this panel multiple objects will be drawn using Graphics2D. Then, using the paint method these objects
will be animated to simulate some sort of abstract wind-movement, this wind movement will impact each object 
differently as some objects are just larger/heavier/etc then others.
